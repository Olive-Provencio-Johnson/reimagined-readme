## Reimagined README

  ## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. As you wrap up any project, remembering what to include in a README when you are new to coding can be daunting. This application prompts the user with each minimally necessary section of a README.md file. This was also a great opportunity to learn more about the inquirer package, and how to generate programs using the CLI.
